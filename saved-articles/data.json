    "notes": "> I’m no Magnus, but as someone who is better at chess than 99% of people,\n\n> Consequently, my theory, even at the time, was that Magnus already personally disliked Hans and as a result lost his cool during the match after a mild opening surprise, played like crap, and blundered.\n\n> computer chess is not human chess\n\n> The stuff Hans is ranting about in the opening clip is where I really started to become vengeful myself. A random joke that went viral about Hans using a device shoved up his behind to cheat started showing up in totally unrelated group chats from people who weren’t even casual observers of the chess scene.\n\nIt matches the opinion that I came to. \n\n- Magnus probably didn't cheat OTB at Sinquefeld Cup\n- The anal beads story was fake and cruel\n- Carlsen and Nakamura used their positions to try to ruin his life\n- There is no money in organizing chess tournaments. They have power because of their fame, fans, distribution, etc",
